# Data Structures and Algorithms
<hr>
## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
after reading and watching the videos provided for this assaignment  I leart that the  data structure can be decided if you want to add ,deleting or dtermining the size of data you want to store also the time consumption.

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
by using condition that will happen eventialy as an example :
```c#
for (int i=0;i<5;i++)
{ Console.WriteLine("a");
}
```

this code will recure until  the i is bigger than 5 the coundition will reach it eventaly becase there is i++ which will make the condition reachable.

## Things I want to know more about:
the best way to difine the time consumption and the recognizing it by big o .
