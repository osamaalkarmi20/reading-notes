## Inheritance:
In object-oriented programming, inheritance enables classes to inherit attributes and methods from parent classes, promoting code reuse and establishing an "is-a" relationship between classes.
## Abstract: 
Abstract classes in OOP serve as blueprints for derived classes and cannot be directly instantiated. They define common interfaces and behavior that derived classes must implement, allowing for consistency and enforcing a contract between related classes.

## Polymorphism: 
Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably through a shared interface or base class. '
This flexibility allows for the usage of different implementations based on the actual type of the object, enhancing code reusability and extensibility.

## OOP Principles:
- Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods into objects, hiding internal implementation details and providing a well-defined interface for interaction.
- Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on representing the essential characteristics and behavior of objects while hiding irrelevant details, allowing for a simplified and high-level view of complex systems.
- Modularity: Modularity emphasizes breaking down a system into smaller, independent modules or components with well-defined responsibilities and interfaces, promoting reusability, maintainability, and collaboration.
- Polymorphism (as mentioned earlier): Polymorphism enables objects to exhibit different behaviors based on their actual type, promoting flexibility and extensibility.
- Inheritance (as mentioned earlier): Inheritance supports code reuse and facilitates the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.
- Composition: Composition involves constructing complex objects by combining simpler objects or components, providing flexibility and avoiding the limitations of single inheritance.
