## MVC vs  Razor Pages
ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a web development framework provided by Microsoft that follows the MVC architectural pattern. MVC separates the application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller. 

In ASP.NET MVC, the model represents the application's data and business logic. It defines how data is structured, accessed, and manipulated. The view is responsible for rendering the user interface, presenting the data to the user. It focuses on the visual representation of the application. Lastly, the controller handles user input, interacts with the model to retrieve and update data, and decides which view should be presented to the user.
On the other hand, Razor Pages is another web development model provided by ASP.NET Core. It is an alternative to the MVC pattern and follows a simpler page-based programming model. In Razor Pages, a single file combines both the view and the controller logic. It provides a streamlined approach for building web applications with less ceremony and overhead compared to MVC.
The main difference between ASP.NET MVC and Razor Pages lies in their approach to organizing and handling requests. MVC focuses on separating concerns and follows a strict separation of responsibilities between models, views, and controllers. It is well-suited for complex applications that require extensive control over routing and handling different types of requests.
Razor Pages, on the other hand, promotes a more straightforward and compact development model by combining the view and controller logic in a single file. It simplifies the development process for small to medium-sized applications where the separation of concerns is less of a concern.
Ultimately, the choice between MVC and Razor Pages depends on the complexity and requirements of your application. MVC provides more flexibility and control, while Razor Pages offers a simpler and more compact approach.

## ASP.NET MVC application with EF

ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a web development framework provided by Microsoft that combines the power of ASP.NET with the Entity Framework (EF), a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool.

In ASP.NET MVC with EF, the MVC pattern is used to structure the application, while EF facilitates the interaction between the application and the underlying database. The model component in MVC represents the application's data and business logic, and EF allows developers to define and work with database entities in a convenient and object-oriented manner.

With EF, developers can define classes that represent database tables, called entity classes, and establish relationships between them using annotations or fluent API configurations. EF takes care of generating the necessary SQL queries and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database. It abstracts away the complexities of working directly with SQL and allows developers to work with data as objects.

In an ASP.NET MVC application with EF, the controller component handles user requests and coordinates the interaction between the model and the view. The controller can use EF to retrieve and manipulate data from the database, perform validations, and apply business logic before passing the data to the view for presentation.

The view component is responsible for rendering the user interface and displaying the data to the user. It can leverage EF to fetch data from the model or interact with the model through the controller to retrieve the necessary data.

Overall, ASP.NET MVC with EF provides a powerful and structured approach to web development, combining the benefits of the MVC pattern for separation of concerns and the convenience of EF for working with databases. It enables developers to build robust, scalable, and data-driven applications with ease.

## Things I want to know more about:
that the tutorial was a bit hard to follow and understand and i hope in the lecture i will understand.
