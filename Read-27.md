A View Model in ASP.NET, particularly in the context of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, refers to a class that separates the data presented in a view from the underlying domain model. It helps maintain cleaner, more independent views and avoids tight coupling with data structures. This is how it's used:

- **Create View Model Class:** Design a class with properties that mirror the data needed in a specific view.

- **Populate View Model:** In the controller, retrieve data from the domain model (like a database) and fill the view model with relevant data.

- **Use View Model in View:** In the view, specify the view model type and utilize its properties to display the required data.

Using view models enhances code organization, guards against unnecessary data exposure, and avoids mixing presentation logic with domain model details.


Creating Forms in ASP.NET MVC:

1. **View Model:** Define a class that represents the form data you want to collect, with properties for each field.

2. **Form View:** Design an HTML form using Razor syntax in a view. Use `Html.BeginForm()` to set form action and method. Utilize `@Html.TextBoxFor()` to generate form fields linked to view model properties.

3. **Form Submission:** Create a controller action to handle form submission. Decorate it with `[HttpPost]` attribute. The action parameter should match the view model.

4. **Validation:** Apply data validation attributes to view model properties for enforcing validation rules on form fields.

5. **Anti-Forgery Token:** Guard against CSRF attacks by including `@Html.AntiForgeryToken()` in the form view and `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]` on the controller action.

6. **Validation Errors:** Show validation error messages using `@Html.ValidationMessageFor()` in the form view when invalid data is submitted.
