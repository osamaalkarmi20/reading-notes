# The Proccess of making a sending Email in Asp.net

To send emails in an ASP.NET application using SendGrid, you'll need to set up SendGrid, configure it with your API key, and then use the SendGrid API to send emails. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

1. **Sign up for SendGrid**:

   If you don't already have a SendGrid account, sign up .

2. **Create an API Key**:

   After signing in to your SendGrid account, navigate to the API Keys section and create a new API key. Keep this key secure as you'll need it in your ASP.NET application.

3. **Install the SendGrid NuGet Package**:

   In your ASP.NET project, you need to install the SendGrid NuGet package to interact with the SendGrid API. You can do this using the Package Manager Console or the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   Install-Package Sendgrid
   ```

4. **Use SendGrid to Send Emails**:

   Now, you can use SendGrid to send emails in your ASP.NET application. Here's an example of how to send a simple email using SendGrid:

   ```csharp
   using System;
   using SendGrid;
   using SendGrid.Helpers.Mail;
   using System.Threading.Tasks;

   namespace YourNamespace
   {
       public class EmailSender
       {
           public async Task SendEmailAsync(string apiKey, string toEmail, string subject, string plainTextContent, string htmlContent)
           {
               var client = new SendGridClient(apiKey);
               var from = new EmailAddress("your@email.com", "Your Name");
               var to = new EmailAddress(toEmail);
               var msg = MailHelper.CreateSingleEmail(from, to, subject, plainTextContent, htmlContent);
               var response = await client.SendEmailAsync(msg);

               if (response.StatusCode != System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Accepted)
               {
                   // Handle the error here
                   throw new Exception($"Failed to send email. Status Code: {response.StatusCode}");
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   Replace `"your@email.com"`, `"Your Name"`, and other placeholders with your own information.

5. **Send an Email**:

   You can now use the `SendEmailAsync` method to send emails in your ASP.NET application:

   ```csharp
   var emailSender = new EmailSender();
   await emailSender.SendEmailAsync("YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY", "recipient@example.com", "Hello, Subject", "Plain text body", "<p>HTML body</p>");
   ```

   Make sure to replace `"YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY"` with the actual API key you obtained from SendGrid.

6. **Handle Errors**:

   It's essential to handle errors appropriately when sending emails. In the example above, we check the response status code and throw an exception if the email sending fails. You may want to implement more robust error handling based on your application's requirements.
