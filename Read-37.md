## Introduction

JAMstack is a modern web development approach that stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It reimagines how websites and web applications are built, emphasizing key principles and benefits.

## Key Principles of JAMstack

1. **Pre-Building:** Content is pre-rendered at build time, improving speed and security.

2. **APIs Everywhere:** APIs connect the front end to back-end services, enhancing flexibility.

3. **Git-based Workflows:** Version control systems like Git manage code and content.

4. **Atomic Deploys:** Sites are deployed in full, reducing deployment risks.

5. **High Security:** Fewer attack vectors make JAMstack sites inherently secure.

6. **CDN Hosting:** Content is served via CDNs for fast, global accessibility.

## Benefits of JAMstack

- **Performance:** Faster load times and improved user experience.
- **Scalability:** Easily handle increased traffic and demand.
- **Security:** Reduced vulnerabilities and enhanced protection.
- **Developer Experience:** Streamlined workflows and modular development.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Cost-effective hosting via CDNs.
