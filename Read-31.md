# Razor Pages

Razor Pages is a feature in ASP.NET Core (formerly known as MVC Core) that makes it easier to build web applications by providing a simpler and more focused programming model compared to traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. 

Think of Razor Pages as a way to create web pages with their associated logic in a single file. It combines both the view and the controller for a specific page into one Razor Page file, typically named with a ".cshtml" extension. This approach is designed to reduce the complexity and boilerplate code often associated with traditional MVC.

## Razor Pages and MVC 

Razor Pages and MVC (Model-View-Controller) are two different approaches to building web applications in ASP.NET Core. They have some key differences in terms of their structure and use cases:

1. **Structure**:
   - **Razor Pages**: In Razor Pages, each web page is self-contained in a single Razor Page file (typically with a ".cshtml" extension). This file combines both the view and the controller logic for that specific page. Razor Pages promote a more page-centric approach to development.
   
   - **MVC**: In MVC, web applications are typically organized into separate components: Models (representing data and business logic), Views (representing the user interface), and Controllers (handling user requests and coordinating the interaction between Models and Views).

2. **Complexity**:
   - **Razor Pages**: They are designed to simplify development, making it easier to create small to medium-sized web applications with less boilerplate code. This can be advantageous for beginners or for projects with simple requirements.

   - **MVC**: MVC provides more flexibility and is well-suited for larger and more complex applications. It separates concerns more explicitly, making it easier to manage and scale a project as it grows.

3. **Routing**:
   - **Razor Pages**: Follow a convention-based routing system where the page's folder structure and file name determine its URL route.

   - **MVC**: Uses explicit routing configuration in the controller to map URLs to specific actions and views.

4. **Use Cases**:
   - **Razor Pages**: Ideal for simple web applications, quick prototypes, or scenarios where you want to keep the logic for each page tightly coupled with the page itself. It's also a good choice for scenarios where you have less complex navigation requirements.

   - **MVC**: Better suited for larger and more complex applications, especially when you need to manage multiple views, complex routing, and a clear separation of concerns. It's also a better fit when building APIs alongside your web application.

5. **Learning Curve**:
   - **Razor Pages**: Has a lower learning curve and can be easier for beginners to grasp because it combines the view and controller logic into a single file.

   - **MVC**: Can have a steeper learning curve due to its more explicit separation of concerns, but it provides a better foundation for understanding web development principles and scaling to complex projects.
