# The Command Line:

the comand line is baiscly a commad as atext code that we write to help navgat and do stuff to our files for example if iwant to see I am were in my folders **(pwd)** will show me what is the path also **(ls)**  will show a list of the things in the folder I am in we can write this in Ubuntu
as linx sub system for wendows users as myself . **(ls -a)**  will show all the hidden files.

# Basic Navigation:
the thing I have obsorved is that we use **(pwd)** to know where are we or in other words what is my current dirictory  in the treminal .
also ls is used to list as stated before  lists all the things in the directory that you are in.
but if you add **(-L)** this is called a long list and it will show to many important info like what dirictory the files are in and the owner of the directory.

 # More About Files:
before reading this part I didnt know that every thing is a file and that this kind of system will be easier to work with in this sutuation also that it works with multiple extentions that will solidify the idea of using diffrent kinds of files also it is a case sinsetive which clears why I had to many issues in the past.

# Manual Pages:

this is the most helpful part as I use to search the internet to know what is a comand for and how to use it as I realized that this **(man)** command could have saved me time and effort with the discription part .

# File Manipulation:
  in  this section one of the mesure things was the -pv  which lets me know wat is happing as I didnt know that I can use the v .
also **(cp)** I have never  used it befor and this will come handy for the next projects. In addition one of the most helpful things is mv. Move a file or directory (can also be used to rename). 

# Cheat Sheet:

this cheat sheet is the most helpful part as it will provide an siple basic description  that will help me as I saved its url as a good resource to help me if I want to implement what I have learned.
