# Dependency Injection & Repository Design Pattern

## Introduction

This document introduces two fundamental principles in contemporary software development - Dependency Injection (DI) and the Repository Design Pattern. These principles play a crucial role in improving code reusability, maintainability, and testability, making them widely adopted techniques in the industry.

## Dependency Injection

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used to implement Inversion of Control (IoC). It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class through different ways. Using DI, we move the creation and binding of the dependent objects outside of the class that depends on them.

The Dependency Injection pattern involves three types of classes:

1. **Client Class**: The client class (dependent class) is a class which depends on the service class.
2. **Service Class**: The service class (dependency) is a class that provides service to the client class.
3. **Injector Class**: The injector class injects the service class object into the client class.

## Repository Pattern

The **Repository pattern** is used for abstracting how data is persisted or retrieved from a database. The idea behind the Repository pattern is to decouple the data access layer from the business access layer of the application so that the operations (such as adding, updating, deleting, and selecting items from the collection) are done through straightforward methods without dealing with database concerns such as connections, commands, and so forth.

## Repository Design Pattern

The **Repository Design Pattern** acts as a middleman or middle layer between the rest of the application and the data access logic. That means a repository pattern isolates all the data access codes from the rest of the application. The advantage of doing so is that, if you need to make any changes, you only need to do it in one place. Another benefit is that testing your controllers becomes easy because the testing framework need not run against the actual database access code. With the Repository Design Pattern, the previous diagram will change to the following diagram.

## SOLID Principle

The **SOLID principles** are a set of golden rules that aim to improve the design and maintainability of software.

**S**: Single-responsibility principle

**O**: Open-closed principle

**L**: Liskov substitution principle

**I**: Interface segregation principle

**D**: Dependency inversion principle

## Why SOLID Matters

1. **Improved maintainability**: You can create code that is easier to maintain and modify over time because the SOLID principles encourage the creation of modular, flexible code that is less prone to errors and more resistant to changes in requirements.

2. **Reduced complexity**: The SOLID principles help to reduce the complexity of software by promoting the use of abstraction and encapsulation, which can make it easier to understand and work with the code.

3. **Enhanced flexibility**: These principles encourage the creation of flexible code that is open to extension but closed to modification, which encourages flexibility without breaking existing functionality.

4. **Increased scalability**: The SOLID principles can help to make software more scalable, as they encourage the use of abstractions and decoupled dependencies, which can help to prevent the codebase from becoming overly complex and difficult to manage.
