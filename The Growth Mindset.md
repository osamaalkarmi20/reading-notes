Carol Dweck researches - "not yet" this thought me that the way to iprove my midset by challanging my self to preform better and investigate
into the growthe of this idea which wasnt relevent before watching the ted video the(“growth mindset” ) which showed clearly that the students with 
the low abilities were able to succeed  by challinging ther selfes.


 Angela Lee Duckworth- ("grit is passion") this thought me  that the passion is more imprtant than talent 
 that shows that the ability of learning is not a talent its more leaing to hard work and passion that will effact the
 person in any learning progression  which concluded to given the best to awork will make you more accomplished  than even the talented personalities.

Alain de Botton - ("what do you do ") i this video that showed me that the mindset for a communication skills and envy  
is a part of the the point of view for things as such as progress in working with any team members and visualize 
what to do as a team member to include the idea of what you can do rather than what you do .


 your emotional intelligence:
in this part I have learnd that i have grown margnaly in the +-relational part and mangment
for my social life to help effect on my life positively.but for the self Awareness par ti need more developmet as i struggle 
in ignoring how others think of me and what is ther perspective about my personality wich effects on my actions.
on the other hand self mangment is the storngs in  my personality and that becuase i stay calm and control my self in hard situations 
.as  a conclusion  i foud that with a little of guidance from the people around you and a good trust with your self you will always improve 
your emotional intelligence.

your biases:
Implicit biases are the stereotypes we hold towards certain groups, which can influence our behavior and interactions. 
recognizing and acknowledging these biases is crucial in order unbiased relationships, enabling more effective collaboration and understanding among team members.
CULTIVATE CONNECTION is a main part that i show strong part in as i get along with all my team mates in the prep course.
EMPATHY AND CURIOSITY i still need to work on empthy as i try to run from talking to new colleges as to avoid uncomfortable situations .
## Things I want to know more about
<hr> 
I want to research more about the growth for the mindsit as i think that this is the most crucial  part .
Also to know how to add growth to the nureal cells as Carol Dweck  improvised in her ted talk.
