# Collections and Enums

## Collections :
Collections are data structures used to group and manage related objects.
They offer functionality for adding, removing, and accessing elements within the collection. Examples include arrays, lists, dictionaries, and sets.
## Enums:
Enums, short for enumerations, are a feature that allows you to define a set of named constant values.
They enable the creation of custom data types with predefined options or states. Enums provide clarity and type safety when working with a fixed set of values in code.

## Things I want to know more about:
I whant to know how to minpulate the functionalty that the collection provides and the use for it the comlexity it adds to the code and does it add any simplfication tothe code or not.
