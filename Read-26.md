## MVC (Model-View-Controller)

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern used in software development to organize applications effectively. It divides the application into three components:

- Model (data and logic)
- View (user interface)
- Controller (handles user input)

This separation improves maintenance, reusability, testing, and collaboration. MVC is used in various contexts, such as web, desktop, and mobile development, with frameworks like ASP.NET MVC and Ruby on Rails implementing it.
