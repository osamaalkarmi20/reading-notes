# LINQ & Delegates 
<hr>

## LINQ:
LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a powerful feature in C# that allows you to query and manipulate data from different data sources, such as collections, arrays, databases, and XML. It provides a convenient way to write queries using a syntax similar to SQL (Structured Query Language). LINQ can be thought of as a tool that helps you search for specific items or information in a collection of things.
Imagine you have a box of toys, and you want to find all the red toys. LINQ allows you to write a query that asks the box to give you only the red toys, and it will return a list of those toys.
## some examples:
there are some examples as basic operation in a LINQ query called  filtering or where.
## Delegates
Delegates, on the other hand, are a way to reference and invoke methods indirectly in C#. You can think of a delegate as a "method pointer" or a "callback function." It allows you to pass methods as arguments to other methods or store them in variables.
delegates can be compared to giving someone a note with instructions on what they should do. You might want someone to do something specific, but instead of doing it yourself, you write down what needs to be done and hand it to them. The person receiving the note (delegate) will follow the instructions and execute the task.
## in conclusion about Delegates :
delegates allow you to define methods separately and then use them in a flexible and indirect manner, making your code more modular and reusable.

In computer programming, delegates are similar. You can write special notes that describe what needs to be done, and then you can pass those notes to other parts of your program. When the time comes, the program follows the instructions in the note and does the task you asked for. It's a way to tell the computer what to do without doing it yourself.

## Things I want to know more about:
the most thing that triggered me is how much they are usful in code and how much simpler amd more readable the code becomes.
