# Interface in C#
## description:
 An interface serves as a contractual agreement between the interface and any class that implements it. 
 By implementing an interface, a class agrees to provide the specified members defined in the interface.
## the difference  between the abstract and the interface:
An abstract class can provide both method implementations and member variables, while an interface only declares member signatures but does not provide any implementation. 
Abstract classes can contain abstract members (methods, properties, etc.) that must be implemented by derived classes, as well as concrete members with an actual implementation.

 A class can inherit from only one abstract class, using the : (colon) notation, whereas it can implement multiple interfaces by separating them with commas. 
 This means that abstract classes support a form of single inheritance, while interfaces support multiple inheritance through implementation.


## Things I want to know more about
the main use of this  consepts and how to implement thim in project  and also what is the diffreance between them and the abctract classes .
